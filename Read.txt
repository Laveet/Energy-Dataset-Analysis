This energy dataset is sourced from a Coursera exercise.
In Excel file I have performed different visualization task by pivot tables.
In Python file i practice my concepts and techniques for data exploration and visualization.
1. Total Electricity generation from both renewable and non renewable is calculated.
2. Unit of electricity capacity and electricity generation is changed from MW to TW.
3. Those technologies having total capacity share less than 2% were combinges in one category 'Other'.
4. Then total installed capacity of each tech is visualized by bar graph and their percentage is visualized by pie chart.
5.Top 10 countries having highest total installed capacities are sorted out. 
6. Total electricity generation from these short listed countries in each year is presented in a pivot table.
7. Total electricity generation trend is visualized in a chart.
